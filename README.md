# Portfolio_Manager

June 3rd, 2024:
Hello, here, one will be able to find the results of my summer project "Portfolio Manager" which will build and (passively) manage my investments in mostly stocks. This project is merely for the sake of fun and I will use the knowledge I have gained from diverse courses at NTNU such as Empirical and Quantitative Methods in Finance (TIØ4317), Optimisation 1 (TMA4180), Stochastic Modelling (TMA4265), Linear Statistical Models (TMA4267), Finance Markets (SØK2005), Macroeconomics (SØK1012), and so on. I will start on the project when I have time and will post the results here.
